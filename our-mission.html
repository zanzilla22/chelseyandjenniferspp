  <h1>Our Mission</h1>
  <p>
    Have you ever wondered what really happens when you drop off your used clothing at curbside donation bins? Contrary to popular belief, the majority of the clothes do not get redistributed to those in need in your local community. Rather, almost 75% of the donated clothes get repurposed, shipped out to other countries for rags, filling, and insulation. Only around 25% are kept, but they are sent to thrift stores for people to buy for a fee. So what happens to those in need?

  <p>
    At 6IX Thrifts, we dedicate ourselves to helping those in our community, with no profits. At all. So will you help Toronto?
